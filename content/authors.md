Until 2018 Elena Seraia was working in the Medical Department of the University of Oxford, in the group of [Radiation Oncology and Biology](https://www.oncology.ox.ac.uk/), aimed at finding ways of comprehensive cancer treatment (e.g. [pubmed21](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33509941/), [pubmed22](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34773074/), or [cmed24](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cam4.70303)), and prior to that worked in [SFGF](https://med.stanford.edu/sfgf.html) (Stanford Functional Genomics Facility) of the [Medical Department at Stanford University](https://med.stanford.edu/), in the group which was the first one to develop the principle of contact printing of oligonucleotide DNA microarrays (see [Nature review](https://www.nature.com/articles/35015701) or this [History of Microarrays story](https://www.news-medical.net/life-sciences/History-of-Microarrays.aspx#:~:text=The%20microarray%20was%20a%20technical,yeast%20genome%20on%20a%20microarray.)). Elena is the key contributor to the 1st edition of the Unifying Physics book, via creating of more than 260 illustrations, and contributing to the chapter on the DNA effects of radiation and cancer therapy.
