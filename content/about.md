This web site serves as a collection of resources (texts, reviews, lecture materials) related to the book “Unifying Physics of Accelerators, Lasers and Plasma (first edition, CRC Press 2015)”, as well as to the  second edition (CRC Press 2023).

The first edition is now in Open Access, thanks to [CERN](https://home.cern/) [“eBooks for all”](https://home.cern/news/announcement/cern/ebooks-all) efforts which selects popular books in accelerator science and work with the publishers to convert them to Open Access.

The second edition has been published in 2023. It added several new chapters, including scientific illustrations of 40 inventive principles, a solution manual, and is featuring color illustrations for the eBook version.
