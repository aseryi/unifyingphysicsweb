Physics today: Questions and Answers with Andrei Seryi

“…the primary target audience is students and postdocs, who are starting to work on advanced concepts of accelerator science. The book will give them concrete knowledge and will also make them more inventive through this robust methodology of inventiveness. If indeed I would need to formulate the primary message of the book in one phrase, I would perhaps say that the book tells the reader, “You can invent,” and it gives the knowledge and methods to support that message…”

EuroScientist: Can Inventiveness in Science be Taught?

The nested doll shown together with the schematics of laser pulses profiles used in the Stimulated Emission Depletion Microscopy (STED, which led Stefan W. Hell to receive the 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry), where the TRIZ inventive principles of the nested doll and of the system/anti-system can be seen.

Case study – Exercise 10.4 from the book

“Mini-project: Define approximate parameters of a 1 GeV compact SR source ring aimed at 10 keV X-rays, based on top-off, on-orbit and on-energy injection by a laser plasma acceleration system. Discuss the research steps required for implementing such a concept.”

This project was the focus of efforts of the USPAS 2016 class, resulted in NA-PAC abstract submitted at the end of one-week lecture course, paper submitted by the students’ team, and the paper selected for a contributing talk!

NA-PAC 2022 tutorial

Tutorial presented at 2022 North American Particle Accelerator Conference (NA-PAC), August 7-12, 2022 in Albuquerque. Title: “Accelerator Science and Technology via Inventive Principles of TRIZ”. Abstract: A swift overview of modern areas of accelerator physics and technology presented via and connected through inventive principles of TRIZ – the industrial methodology of inventiveness. Wide range of topics, from synchrotron radiation to electron cooling, or plasma acceleration, to name a few, introduced via easy to follow back-of-the-envelope derivations, and connected via canonical yet adjusted for science TRIZ inventive principles and laws, are illustrated by numerous inventions such as fiber lasers, tune jumps, inverted guns, and many others. This short tutorial is a gateway opening to you a new approach, which creates an amalgam of science and industrial inventiveness, enhances creativity and boosts innovations towards developing the next generations of accelerators and their applications.
